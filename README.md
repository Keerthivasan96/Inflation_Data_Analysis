Global Inflation Analysis Dashboard

🚀 Moto
"Empowering economic insights through transparent, interactive analysis of global inflation trends—unlocking data-driven understanding for researchers, policymakers, and enthusiasts."

📚 Project Overview
This project explores global inflation data over the past 65 years, combining careful data analysis and interactive visualization to examine patterns across countries, regions, and income groups. I built an intuitive dashboard that allows users to select filters and visually compare inflation rates, volatility, and emerging trends. The dataset is sourced directly from the World Bank, covering 200+ countries.

🔑 Key Insights & Conclusions
Inflation rates have varied dramatically by region and country, with developed economies generally maintaining stability while emerging markets often experience volatility.

Recurring hyperinflation episodes in areas like Africa and Latin America are tightly linked to political instability, currency collapse, or conflict, as seen in Congo, Bolivia, and Ukraine.

High-income countries show lower inflation volatility thanks to stronger institutions and fiscal discipline.

After 2020, a fresh wave of global inflation arose, driven by supply chain disruptions and post-pandemic recovery shocks.

My forecasting models suggest moderate inflation will persist in economies like India, while regions facing political fragility may see sudden swings.

The dashboard empowers stakeholders to interactively explore these inflation dynamics, providing insights for smarter policy and business decisions.
